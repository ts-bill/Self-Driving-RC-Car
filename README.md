## Abstract

The Propose of this research is to the design-driven system of a self-driving car
for making people feel safer. This research use RC car instead of the real car and the
driving process is using image processing, machine learning and ROS program
for making the RC car can drive without human operators. Driving process use to lane
detection, object detection and traffic light detection, which are the important things in
a self-driving car system.
